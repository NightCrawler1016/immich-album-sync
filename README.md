# Immich Album Sync

A Docker container with a **web UI** for performing one-way album syncs between two [Immich](https://immich.app) servers. Built for Unraid but works on any Docker host.

```
Immich A (private)  ──────────────▶  Immich B (public/family)
    Master library                       Curated albums only
```

## Features

- 🖥️ **Web UI** — configure sync jobs, view status, stream live logs from the browser
- 🔐 **Password-protected** — username/password login; forced password change on first login
- 🔑 **Encrypted API keys** — all API keys are AES-encrypted at rest; never stored or rendered in plaintext
- 📅 **Cron scheduling** — configurable per-job schedule, runs automatically in the background
- 📸 **Preserves originals** — downloads and uploads raw files with EXIF and GPS intact
- 🍎 **Live Photo support** — automatically pairs `.HEIC` + `.MOV` files
- 🔁 **Duplicate-safe** — uses `immich-go` for smart duplicate detection on the destination
- 📱 **Mobile-responsive** — works on phones, tablets, and desktops
- 🚀 **Multi-job** — sync multiple albums with different schedules and servers
- 🔍 **API permission checker** — test and verify required Immich API key permissions per job
- 📦 **Support bundle** — one-click download of logs, sanitized config, and run history for troubleshooting

## Quick Start (Unraid)

### Option A — Community Applications XML Template

1. In Unraid, go to **Apps → My Apps** (or add a template manually)
2. Use the XML template from this repository: `immich-album-sync.xml`
3. Set a unique `SECRET_KEY` (32–64 random characters — see [Security](#security))
4. Start the container and open `http://your-unraid-ip:8080`
5. Log in with `admin` / `admin` — you will be prompted to set a new password immediately

### Option B — Unraid Docker UI (manual)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `ghcr.io/nightcrawler1016/immich-album-sync:latest` |
| Name | `immich-album-sync` |
| Port | `8080` → `8080` |
| Path `/app/appdata` | `/mnt/user/appdata/immich-album-sync` |
| Variable `SECRET_KEY` | A 32–64 character random string (required) |
| Variable `TZ` | Your timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`) |

### Option C — docker-compose

```yaml
services:
  immich-album-sync:
    image: ghcr.io/nightcrawler1016/immich-album-sync:latest
    container_name: immich-album-sync
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./appdata:/app/appdata
    environment:
      SECRET_KEY: "replace-this-with-a-32-to-64-char-random-string"
      TZ: "America/New_York"
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` and log in with `admin` / `admin`.

> **First-login password change is required.** You will be redirected automatically on first login.

## Security

### First-login Password Change

On first login with the default credentials (`admin` / `admin`), the application immediately redirects to a password-change screen. You **cannot access any other page** until a new password is set. The default password cannot be reused.

### API Key Encryption

All Immich API keys entered in sync job forms are encrypted before being stored in the SQLite database using **AES-128 (Fernet)** with a key derived from your `SECRET_KEY`. Keys are:

- Never stored in plaintext
- Never rendered in HTML (form fields always show empty; a "Key stored securely" indicator is shown instead)
- Decrypted only in memory at sync runtime

### SECRET_KEY Requirements

| Constraint | Value |
|---|---|
| Minimum length | 16 characters |
| **Recommended length** | **32–64 characters** |
| Maximum length | 128 characters (longer provides no additional benefit) |

Generate a strong key: [1Password Generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/) — select 32–64 characters with all character types.

> **Important:** Changing `SECRET_KEY` after the initial setup will **invalidate all stored API keys** (they were encrypted with the old key) and log out all active sessions. You will need to re-enter API keys for every sync job.

### Session Security

Sessions are signed with `SECRET_KEY` using `itsdangerous` and expire after 24 hours.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | ✅ Yes | `change-me` | 32–64 char random string for session signing and API key encryption |
| `TZ` | No | `UTC` | Container timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`) |
| `CLEANUP_CACHE` | No | `false` | Delete cached files after final upload (`true`/`false`) |
| `CACHE_PATH` | No | `/app/appdata/cache` | Download cache directory (see [Cache on external storage](#cache-on-external-storage-or-a-different-disk)) |
| `BATCH_SIZE_MB` | No | `10240` | Max MB to stage before uploading a batch (0 = unlimited) |
| `BATCH_FILE_COUNT` | No | `0` | Max files per batch (0 = unlimited, size limit still applies) |
| `DB_PATH` | No | `/app/appdata/config.db` | SQLite database path |
| `LOG_PATH` | No | `/app/appdata/logs/sync.log` | Sync log file path |

---

## Volume Mount

| Container path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/app/appdata` | All persistent data: database, cache, and logs |

Map this to a path on your Unraid array, e.g. `/mnt/user/appdata/immich-album-sync`.

### Cache on External Storage or a Different Disk

For large first-time syncs (hundreds of GB or multi-TB albums), you may want the download cache on a high-capacity array disk, a separate SSD pool, or a network share — rather than your primary Unraid cache pool.

**Unraid / Docker setup:**

1. Add a **second Path mapping** in the Docker template:
   - Container path: `/app/cache`
   - Host path: `/mnt/user/YourLargeDisk/immich-sync-cache` *(or any writable path)*
2. Set the `CACHE_PATH` environment variable to: `/app/cache`

The sync engine will write all downloaded originals to that path. The main `/app/appdata` volume (database, logs) is unaffected.

**docker-compose example:**

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./appdata:/app/appdata          # database + logs
  - /mnt/big-drive/sync-cache:/app/cache   # large cache on separate disk
environment:
  CACHE_PATH: /app/cache
```

## Web UI Pages

| Page | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/` | Overview of all jobs, recent runs, and status |
| Sync Jobs | `/jobs` | List, create, edit, delete, and pause sync jobs |
| New Job | `/jobs/new` | Configure source server, destination server, album, and schedule |
| Live Logs | `/logs` | Real-time streaming sync log with copy and support bundle download |
| Settings | `/settings` | Change username and password |

---

## Setting Up a Sync Job

1. Open **Sync Jobs → New Job**
2. Enter the **Source Server** (your private Immich) URL and API key
3. Enter the **Destination Server** (your family/public Immich) URL and API key
4. Use the **Test Connection** button to verify API key permissions before saving
5. Select the source album name (populated from the test result)
6. Set a cron schedule (e.g. `0 23 * * *` for 11 PM daily)
7. Save — the job will run on schedule automatically

### Required API Key Permissions

| Server | Required Permissions |
|---|---|
| Source (Immich A) | `album.read`, `asset.read` |
| Destination (Immich B) | `album.read`, `album.write`, `asset.read`, `asset.write` |

See [Immich API Key documentation](https://immich.app/docs/features/api-keys) for how to create keys with specific permissions.

## Batch Processing

The sync engine automatically processes large albums in rolling batches to prevent the local cache from filling up your disk.

### How batching works

Instead of downloading the entire album before uploading anything, the engine:

1. Downloads files until either `BATCH_SIZE_MB` or `BATCH_FILE_COUNT` is reached
2. Uploads that batch to the destination server
3. Clears the batch from the cache
4. Repeats until all files are processed

The **final batch** respects your `CLEANUP_CACHE` setting — intermediate batches are always cleared.

### Defaults

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BATCH_SIZE_MB` | `10240` (10 GB) | Flush every 10 GB of downloaded data |
| `BATCH_FILE_COUNT` | `0` | No file-count limit (size limit still applies) |

With the default 10 GB limit, syncs under 10 GB behave exactly as before (single batch). Syncs over 10 GB are automatically split — you'll see progress in the live log like:

```
─── Batch 1: 247 files (9.98 GB) — 831 items remaining ───
   Batch 1: 212 uploaded to destination
   Batch 1: cache cleared, ready for next batch
─── Batch 2: 231 files (10.01 GB) — 600 items remaining ───
...
```

### Tuning for your setup

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Unraid cache pool is small (< 50 GB) | Lower `BATCH_SIZE_MB` to `5120` (5 GB) or `2048` (2 GB) |
| Cache on large array disk or NAS share | Raise `BATCH_SIZE_MB` or set to `0` (disable) |
| Very large files (4K video, RAW) | Lower `BATCH_FILE_COUNT` to `100–250` |
| Want to disable batching entirely | Set both `BATCH_SIZE_MB=0` and `BATCH_FILE_COUNT=0` |

---

## How It Works

1. At the scheduled time, the sync engine connects to **Immich A** via its REST API
2. Finds the configured source album by name and lists all assets
3. Downloads all original files (including Live Photo `.MOV` companions) to the local cache
4. Uploads to **Immich B** using [`immich-go`](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go) (v0.31.0), which performs duplicate detection on the destination
5. Logs all activity to `/app/appdata/logs/sync.log`, viewable live in the browser

Files already present in the cache are skipped on re-download. `immich-go` skips files already present on the destination server.

## Docker Image Tags

| Tag | Branch | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `latest` | `main` | Stable production release |
| `dev` | `dev` | Development builds — may be unstable |
| `v1.2.3` | git tag | Pinned version releases |

```bash
# Pull latest stable
docker pull ghcr.io/nightcrawler1016/immich-album-sync:latest

# Pull dev build
docker pull ghcr.io/nightcrawler1016/immich-album-sync:dev
```

---

## Building Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NightCrawler1016/immich-album-sync.git
cd immich-album-sync
docker build -t immich-album-sync:local .
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SECRET_KEY=my-local-dev-secret-32-chars-long \
  -v $(pwd)/appdata:/app/appdata \
  immich-album-sync:local
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Download Support Bundle

In the **Live Logs** page, click **Download Support Bundle** to get a ZIP containing:
- `sync.log` — full sync log
- `jobs.json` — job configurations (API keys redacted)
- `sync_runs.json` — last 100 run records
- `system_info.json` — Python version, immich-go version, paths

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Container starts but no logs | Wrong volume mapping | Ensure `/app/appdata` is mapped to a writable host path |
| "Invalid username or password" | Wrong credentials | Default is `admin` / `admin`; check Settings if you changed it |
| API key test fails | Insufficient permissions | Use Immich's API key settings to grant required roles (see table above) |
| `SECRET_KEY` warning in logs | Using default or short key | Set a 32–64 character unique key in environment variables |
| Sync runs but 0 uploads | Duplicates already on dest | Normal — `immich-go` skips files already present |
| Album not visible after sync | Immich UI cache | Refresh your Immich browser tab or wait a moment |

## Notes on immich-go

This container pins [`immich-go`](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go) to **v0.31.0** for stability. The upload command used internally:

```bash
immich-go upload from-folder \
  --server DEST_URL \
  --api-key DEST_KEY \
  --into-album "Album Name" \
  --recursive /path/to/cache
```

> Note: flags must appear **after** `from-folder` in v0.31.0. Earlier versions used different syntax.
